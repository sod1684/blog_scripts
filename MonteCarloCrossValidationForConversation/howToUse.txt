1. Download the JSON for your conversation and save it as "conversation.json"
   in the workarea folder. 
   
2. Run the python file "createTestTrain.py". This will generate your test and
   train files. 
   
3. In Bluemix create a new Watson Conversation service. Go to service
   credentials and make a note of it. It should look something like this. 
    
   {
     "url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/conversation/api",
     "password": "H5k3ro234fTK",
     "username": "34f3142e-12fc-22a1-c4d4-374629271639"
   }
   
4. Go to the conversation workspace for this service, and import the following
   files in your workspace.
   
      conversation_train1.json
      conversation_train2.json
      conversation_train3.json
  
5. Make a note of the workspace IDs. 

6. Open "runTestAndTrain.py" on the line: 

     ctx = {}
     
   Change the {} to your credentials in step 3. 
   
     ctx = {
         "url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/conversation/api",
         "password": "H5k3ro234fTK",
         "username": "34f3142e-12fc-22a1-c4d4-374629271639"
     }
     
7. Change the workspace IDs line to add your workspaces. Example: 

			workspace_ids = [
			    '',
			    '',
			    ''
			    ] 
    
    to:
    
 			workspace_ids = [
			    'f941ab0e-f01e-430b-9882-90ed279b3978',
			    '7d278c38-5a6c-4d7d-9177-5fef3b3575a6',
			    '02945373-61c9-4471-8345-804979cd4d6a'
			    ] 

8. Check that your conversation workspaces are fully trained before continuing.

9. Run the script "runTestAndTrain.py". You will need to install the Watson
   Python SDK kit for it to work. It will then test all your "test" sets. 
   
Once it's completed you should have three report files created in your work 
area. You can use these reports to see how your system is performing. 

The report files can be opened in most spreadsheet programs.
