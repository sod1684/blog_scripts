    "|`output.nodes_visited`|Debugging Qualitive |This can be used to see how a progression through a tree happens|\n",
    "|`context.conversation_id`|All|Use this to group users conversation together. In some solutions however, one pass calls are sometimes done mid conversation. So if you do this, you need to factor that in.|\n",

    "|`system.branch_exited_reason`|Debugging|If `branch.exited` is `true` then this will tell the why. `completed` means that the branch found a matching node, and finished. `fallback` means that it could not find a matching node, so it jumps back to `root` to find the match.|\n",
    "|`context.???`|All|You may have context variables you want to capture. You can either do these individually, or code to remove conversation objects and grab what remains|\n",
    "|`request_timestamp`|Quantitive Qualitative|When conversation received the users response.|\n",
    "|`response_timestamp`|Quantitive Qualitative|When conversation responded to the user. You can do a delta to see if there are conversation performance issues, but generally keep one of the timestamp fields for analysis.\n",
